Welcome to the Limb family website
{{< /lead >}}

This site is still under construction. The Limb family has the following members:

| Name                                       | Role                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| [Mark Limb]({{< ref "mark" >}})            | Daddy of the household         |
| [Michelle Limb]({{< ref "michelle" >}})    | Mummy of the household         |
| Matthew Limb                               | Adventure boy of the household |
| Andy Limb                                  | Screen master of the household |

It is currently a demo site using the Congo theme. It contains a complete set of [theme documentation]({{< ref "docs" >}}). Congo is flexible and is great for both static page-based content (like this demo) or a traditional blog with a feed of recent posts.

Explore the [sample pages]({{< ref "samples" >}}) to get a feel for what Congo can do. If you like what you see, check out the project on [Github](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) or read the [Installation guide]({{< ref "docs/installation" >}}) to get started.
